Software vs Hardware :

1) Software does not wear out it deteriorates while hardware wears out with time.

2) The curve for software is not a idealized curve and states that high failure rate in early life of software , during its life software undergoes changes and curve spikes with error caused by every change with minimum failure rate rises (increased failure rate due to side effects of changes).
The Bath Tub Curve for hardware shows that hardware include high failure rate early in the lify cycle (design and manufacturing phase). Defects and failure rate drops to a steady level for some time and rises again due to environmental factors causing its wearout forming the graph like a bath tub.

3) Software is a logical unit (intangible in nature) and hardware is a physical unit (tangible).

4) There are no spare parts in software unlikely to hardware. (Spare parts are independent of each other while software modules are dependent.)

5) Clearly specified problem statement in case of hardware.

6) Requirements may change with time for software but not for hardware.

7) Multiple copies creation is cheap for software as compared to hardware.
