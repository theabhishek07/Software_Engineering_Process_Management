Data Flow Diagrams : A DFD shows the flow of data through the system and is also used for modelling the requirements. and also known as Bubble chart or Data Flow Graph.

    Symbols used :
                  
                  1.Circle (Process) - depicts process that transforms data inputs into data outputs.
                  2.Curved Arrow (Dataflow) - shows flow of data into or out of a process or data store.
                  3.Rectangle (Source or Sink) - external entity that acts as a source of system input or sink of system outputs.
 
                  Data Store is a data repository of data items.
				  
	Some important points : 
	                        ->unique names are important.
			        ->DFDs depict flow of data and not order of events like a flowchart.
                		->Decision paths (diamond nodes) represent logical expressions are not specified.
							
	Leveling in a DFD : DFD can be drawn to represent the system at different levels of abstraction.
                        
                        Higher level DFDs are partitioned or refined into lower levels having more information and functional details.						
											
	Level 0 DFD : (also known as Context diagram or fundamental) represents the entire system as a single bubble with input and output data indicated by incoming and outgoing arrows.	

               Decompose this entire bubble into multiple bubbles with each bubble decomposed into more DFDs.
