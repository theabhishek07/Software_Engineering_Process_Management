Software engineering is a systematic approach to the development, operation and maintenance of desired software.

Dual role of software = 

1) As a product =  delivers the computing potential of a hardware
                   enables the hardware to  deliver expected functions
                   acts as information transformer for bussiness and personal information.

2) As a vehicle for delivering the product = helps in creation and control of other programs
                                             Example = Operating system


Q) Why software engineering is important ?

= enables us to build complex systems software in a timely manner.
= ensures high quality software.
= imposes discipline to work that can become quite chaotic.


Q) What is a work product (Result / Outcome)

1) Software Engineer = the set of programs, the content (data) along with documentation that is a part of software.

2) User /Customer = the functionality delivered by the software that improves user experience.


Software Engg. Focuses On = 

1) Quality (while software development) : Functional and Non-Functional Qualities. 

     Functional (degree to which correct software is produced depending on user demands and feedbacks)
     Non-Functional (features other than functions of a software like robustness)
	 Non-Functional Qualities are also known as Structural Attributes
             

2) Maintainability (after the software has been developed and delivered) : should be easily enhanced and adaption to changing requirements whenever needed.
